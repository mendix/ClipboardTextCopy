## Typical usage scenario

Improve user experience by reducing clicks of a user copying text from an input element.

## Configuration

- Specify a classname in the classname propery of the text input element of which the text should be copied.

- Specify the same classname in the 'Target element classname' property of this widget.

Make sure that your page doesn't contain multiple elements with the same classname as this will lead to unexpected behaviour.
